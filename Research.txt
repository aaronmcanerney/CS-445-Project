Session Hijacking Research:

1. IP spoofing - attacker uses source-routed IP packets to insert commands into an active
communication between two nodes on a network and disguising itself as one of the authenticated users.

IP spoofing is possible because it is done at the start of a TCP session

The attacker will sniff a legitimate session and take it over.


2. Cross Site Scripting

Attacker can send malicious Javascript to a victim. When the link is clicked,
the Javascript will run and complete the instructions made by the attacker.

Cross Site Scripting can be stopped by sanitizing input.

Found a vulnerable website (DVWA) that can be used to test cross site scripting
on kali linux

Steps to set up DVWA:

1. Log onto kali linux
2. open terminal and run: sudo service apache2 start
3. run: sudo service mysql start
4. check status run: sudo service mysql status
5. go to localhost/dvwa
6. log in to site with username=admin password=password
7. Go to DVWA Security and make sure the level is low (if it is no set it to low)
