Cross site scripting:

What I have learned so far:

1. An Attacker can send malicious Javascript to a victim. When the link is clicked,
the Javascript will run and complete the instructions made by the attacker.

Cross Site Scripting can be stopped by sanitizing input.

2. How to install DVWA on Kali linux (although my box stopped booting)

DVWA is an intentionally vulnerable web app that i will use to test XSS attackes.

Once my vm boots up I will create a snaptshot and provide it on this repo, so it can be used to test my code
