Cross site scripting:

What I have learned so far:

1. An Attacker can send malicious Javascript to a victim. When the link is clicked,
the Javascript will run and complete the instructions made by the attacker.

Cross Site Scripting can be stopped by sanitizing input.

2. How to install DVWA on Kali linux

DVWA is an intentionally vulnerable web app that i will use to test XSS attackes.

3. I have shared two videos, one showing a cross site scripting attack on a vulnerable site, and another utilizing my javascript cleaner that cleans malicious javascript code so that the attack is stopped.
